02. Advanced CSS: Portfolio

The task was to creat a portfolio for employers but I recevied permission to design an introductory website mockup for my business.

Top section name of the company with a menu of services. The links should go to the section of the page it references.

In the first section "Photography" I made the image of the camera a "click on" image and it will open a pdf about general information.
The text in the box also notes to click on it for more info.

In the contact section, I also have the email address and would eventually add linked in, twitter, etc. 



Note: Tried very hard to use the card, flex box and even tried the 3 column layout. I always have my eye on design so if things don't lay properly it sets me back quite a bit timewise. At some point, I feel like I just run out of time.
